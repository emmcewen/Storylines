# Storylines

## Description

Storylines is a website that allows you to explore your writing creativity. Once you sign up for an account, you can create new stories to share with other collaborators. With this application, you can submit a few paragraphs of a story that you want to start and other collaborators can continue to add onto your story. In the end, the story can and will take many twists and turns that are completely unexpected. You can create as many stories as you would like, as well as contribute to other collaborators stories as well. Sign up and let your imagination run wild!
